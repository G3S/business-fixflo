    Any problems or errors will result in a Business::Fixflo::Exception

    appropriate error catching code (TryCatch in the below example):

        use TryCatch;

        try {
        }
        catch ( Business::Fixflo::Exception $e ) {
            # error specific to Business::Fixflo
            ...
            say $e->message;  # error message
            say $e->code;     # HTTP status code
            say $e->response; # HTTP status message
        }
        catch ( $e ) {
            # some other failure?
            ...
        }
